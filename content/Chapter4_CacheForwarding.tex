\chapter{Web Cache Object Forwarding From Desktop to Mobile for Energy Consumption Optimizations}

\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

With the beginning of the 21st century, networking support for wirelessly connected mobile user devices has fueled a continuous increase in the demand for mobile data.
Web requests now originate in a majority from wirelessly connected user devices -- a trend that Cisco, Inc. predicts to continue in the foreseeable future~\cite{VNI14}.
Simultaneously, the overall user behavior and demand for more rich media inclusion into web pages has increased the overall amount of data that is required to be transmitted per page, see, e.g., \cite{IhPa11,BuMaSe13}.
Caching on the client side has been effectively used in the past and was, together with increased numbers of parallel object downloads, able to decrease wait times for desktop clients as reported in \cite{IhPa11}.
A first view of mobile web page characteristics (which were found to exhibit lower complexity than regular desktop browser versions) and non-landing pages (which were found to be less complex than landing pages) was evaluated by the authors of~\cite{BuMaSe13}.
Moreover, a significant body of research has emerged that focuses on content delivery optimizations to mobile devices.

Typically, these optimization approaches are targeting on-device optimizations or off--device cloud--based improvements.
For mobile applications, for example, significant energy savings were found to be attainable when grouping application requests so as to avoid prolonged cellular network interface activity, see, e.g., \cite{BaBaVe09,QiWaGaHuGe12}.
Other approaches optimize the delivery to mobile devices through proxies and cloud-based data anticipation and traffic shaping, see, e.g., \cite{XiHuSaYl11}.

For web data, typically caching is used to limit the amount of data that has to be transfered to requesting clients.
In prior works focusing on mobile web page delivery optimizations, such as \cite{SaIs02}, energy optimization has been a key element, due to the limiting restrictions for mobile clients.
One particular area for optimization is the pre--fetching of web page objects combined with caching (which allows to download data before usage), such as presented in~\cite{ShKuDaWa05} with about 10 \% energy savings.
More recently, these approaches were combined with user connectivity predictions, see, e.g., \cite{ThChWo13}.

\begin{figure}

	\caption{Screenshot of rendered web page from WebPageSpeedTest.org. As illustrated, the main textual and pictorial content items are flanked by background and interactive advertisements.}
\label{fig:cache_forwarding_setup}
\end{figure}

We propose to utilize a basic cache forwarding method that can be utilized by users to synchronize from, e.g., a desktop computer, to their mobile device, e.g., a smartphone.
We illustrate this approach in Figure~\ref{fig:cache_forwarding_setup}, which contains the desktop and a mobile device. 
As most devices are charged over night, or are at least stationary within local area network ranges, we propose to utilize this general idle period to allow direct forwarding of cached objects.
We presume that browser clients will have a shared information source in the cloud that allows the identification of visited web pages, an approach most browser clients take to date.
In turn, clients are enabled to identify web page objects that are identical between the different device display modalities, i.e., identical web objects delivered when requesting a desktop/mobile versions of a web page.
The thus transmitted objects, in turn, reside locally within the mobile device cache and do not require an energy--expensive mobile download through cellular interfaces. 
We note that the reverse of this approach is possible as well.
To support our approach, we gather data through the publicly accessible \url{WebpageSpeedTest.org} website as well as the \url{httparchive.org} archive of a large dataset of performance evaluations for popular web pages; we refer the interested reader to~\cite{Me13} for a more detailed discussion.

\section*{Individual Example}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
\label{s:example}
In this section, we outline an individual example for the German news web page ``Der Spiegel,'' accessible at \url{http://www.spiegel.de}.
This web page serves as an example for a rich media and advertising material containing web presence that is frequently updated.
On February 12, 2014, we performed a speed test online using ($i$) Internet Explorer 9 as the browser instance for a desktop client, ($ii$) Chrome as the mobile browser on a Google Nexus 5 instance, and ($iii$) Safari for an iPhone 4 instance provided by \url{WebpageSpeedTest.org} (both mobile clients were traffic shaped to 3G connection emulations).
An example screenshot of the web page as rendered is provided in Figure~\ref{fig:screens}.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1,keepaspectratio,width=\columnwidth]{1screen}
	\caption{Screenshot of rendered web page from WebPageSpeedTest.org. As illustrated, the main textual and pictorial content items are flanked by background and interactive advertisements.}
\label{fig:screens}
\end{figure}

As illustrated, the web page exhibits a significant amount of objects that are required for advertisements, visual items (images, layout), and scripting.

We evaluate the reported data as follows. 
For each display modality and browser client, we gather the individual web objects requested and the response sizes and headers for caching information (for HTTP response codes 200 only, as we are not interested in redirects).
We denote the number of all objects returned for a request modality (i.e., Internet Explorer for the desktop client example and iPhone or Nexus 5 for mobile counterparts) as $N$, their average size as $\overline{X}$, the standard deviation of their sizes as ${\sigma}_{X}$, and the Coefficient of Variation (CoV) of the returned object sizes as $\mathrm{CoV}_{X}$. 
As in the HTTP specification, the \emph{max--age} directive overrides others, so we initially consider that directive for the cache longevity of the individual objects. 
If no explicit information is found, we consider the response header's \emph{expires} information, which provides a secondary cache lifetime. 
If both are not found, or if the \emph{expires} date is in the past or right at the request time, we set the cache lifetime to zero. 
Similar to the notation for the object sizes, we denote the expiration time characteristics as $\overline{T}$, $\sigma_{T}$, and $\mathrm{CoV}_{T}$, respectively.

\subsection*{Data Description}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data Description}

We provide an initial high-level overview of the web page characteristics for \url{http://www.spiegel.de} as requested by the different clients in Table~\ref{tab:spiegel}.
\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{High-level overview of different client web page statistics for http://www.spiegel.de}
\label{tab:spiegel}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}
	\hline
	Statistic          & IE Deskt. &    iPhone &   Nexus 5 \\ \hline
	$N$                &       154 &       132 &       145 \\ \hline\hline

	$\sigma$           &  19103.19 &  13438.05 &  25684.58 \\ \hline
	$\mathrm{CoV}_{X}$ &      1.84 &      1.52 &      2.52 \\ \hline\hline
	$\overline{T}$     & 106285.14 & 114780.69 & 114818.28 \\ \hline
	$\sigma_{T}$       & 125080.27 & 125576.65 & 126090.90 \\ \hline
	$\mathrm{CoV}_{T}$ &      1.18 &      1.09 &      1.10 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We initially observe that the desktop version (with Internet Explorer 9 as requesting browser client) exhibits the highest number of objects, followed by the mobile Chrome/Android and Safari mobile/iOS versions.
Interestingly, there is only a minor difference in the number of objects between these versions.
Next, we observe that the trend for the average number of bytes is aligned with the number of elements. 
In total, the mobile Chrome version is almost on par with the desktop one (at 92~\% of total data); only the Safari mobile version seems optimized (at 72~\% of total data).
The standard deviation and Coefficient of Variation (CoV) amongst individual element sizes are highest for the mobile Chrome version, indicating more significant size differences than for the safari version (which is one unit lower), while the desktop version falls into the middle.

Next, we evaluate the elements' caching properties on a high level as presented in Table~\ref{tab:spiegel} as well. 
Overall, we note that the highest average caching time is observed for the mobile Chrome access with the Nexus 5 device, trailed immediately by the iOS access and (with distance) by the desktop browser.
We note that the overall variability in terms of expiration times amongst elements is fairly low and comparable, as indicated by CoV values around 1.1.

\subsection*{Evaluation of Local Cache Forwarding}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Evaluation of Local Cache Forwarding}
We now shift the view to the possibility for identical objects to be re--utilized locally to avoid additional download penalties in time and energy consumption.
Simultaneous with a web page request, a local broadcast could ``ask'' for the cached elements for a website to be delivered locally from participating clients. 
Alternatively, cellular provisioning methods, such as in LTE--A, could initiate the device--to--device local exchange as well.
Once the request is received, the local coordination can take place, which inherently results in the forwarding of elements that are the same across browser instances and which have a future cache lifetime expiration.

We filter out elements that are not similar amongst the different requesting devices, which results in 82 objects with the same URL and size combination. 
In other words, just above half of the objects constituting the web page under consideration are identical between different clients.

While we note an identical cache lifetime for most of these objects, a slight increase is notable from the Desktop over Safari to Chrome clients.  
Next, we remove items that exhibit a cache lifetime of zero for any of the three requesting clients, resulting in 59 objects.
These remaining objects display a reduced average cache lifetime for the mobile browsers, whereby mobile Chrome exhibits the shortest.
In turn, we choose the iOS Safari mobile as our exemplary base for calculations. 
We utilize the approximations for energy consumptions presented in~\cite{PeFiWi11} to determine the amount of energy required if local data forwarding can be performed using either Bluetooth or WLAN technologies. 
We illustrate the energy consumption as function of time in Figure~\ref{fig:ios_time_energy}.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1,keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth]{energy_ios_time}
		\caption{Energy required to download web page data via cellular connection or through combination with partial local exchange with Bluetooth/WLAN.}
\label{fig:ios_time_energy}
\end{figure}

The complete download energy for exclusive use of cellular is the upper limit on energy spent downloading the data associated with the web page. 
The Bluetooth and WLAN data exchanges with other local clients both follow the same underlying trend with increasing energy required to transmit all data as time progresses from the last access point in time (due to cache expirations).

We illustrate the relative amount of data/items within the cache in addition to the attainable savings in Figure~\ref{fig:rel_ios_time} as a function of delayed access time. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1,keepaspectratio,width=\columnwidth]{rel_ios_time}
	\caption{Relative number of items and data amounts in cache and savings resulting from local data exchange with a desktop client.}
\label{fig:rel_ios_time}
\end{figure}

We observe that a significant amount of the overall data can be cached (and would in turn be suitable for localized forwarding).
We additionally observe that even for longer durations up to multiple days, significant amounts of data remain in the cache.
Combining the forwarding from locally cooperating clients, e.g., user-owned desktop computer in the same network through either Bluetooth or WLAN technologies, we utilize the approximations outlined in~\cite{Se13} to derive the relative gains of our approach in terms of energy consumption. 
Specifically, we compare our approach (combining locally forwarded cached objects and cellular downloads of the remainder) with the regular download of all objects through the cellular network interface. 
We note that significant savings above 20 \% are attainable with our approach, even if the filling of the device's cache is performed wirelessly as well.

\section*{Large Dataset Performance Evaluation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Large Dataset Performance Evaluation}
\label{s:large}
We now evaluate our proposed approach through simulations based on a large dataset of landing web pages of popular websites.
For this purpose, we retrieved the publicly available web page response details from \emph{httparchive.org} and created a subsequent dataset for October 1st, 2013.

\subsection{Dataset Description}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Dataset Description}
The dataset we utilize for the performance evaluation contains the individual web responses for the most popular websites of fixed (Internet Explorer for the desktop) and mobile (iOS for iPhone 4) websites, ranked through the Alexa popularity index.
Furthermore, the dataset contains the individual response details, including cache expiration times and sizes. 

Similar to the individual web page example, we provide an overall description of the response sizes and maximum expiration ages in Table~\ref{tab:dataset}.

\end{tabularx}
\end{table*}
We note that the overall average response size as result of desktop requests (when batched into the outlined time frames) is around 17 kB, with the largest average sizes occurring between one and twelve hours.
Mostly, we note that the majority of objects exhibit a short expiration time between zero and 30 seconds.
For the responses to mobile devices, we note that the majority of objects are in the same short time span and the long time span of more than one day.
The highest average response sizes, however, are observed between one hour and half a day, in difference to the desktop counterpart.
For more details of the differences between fixed and mobile web pages, we refer to~\cite{JoSe14Commag}.

We illustrate the cumulative distribution for the desktop and mobile client response expiration ages in Figure~\ref{fig:comp_cpd}.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1,keepaspectratio,width=\columnwidth]{comp_cpd}
	\caption{Cumulative probability of expiration times for desktop and mobile responses.}
\label{fig:comp_cpd}
\end{figure}

We observe that a significant portion ($>40$ \%) of responses from web servers exhibits an immediate expiration and would, in turn, require an immediate retrieval by clients.
The cumulative expiration probability is higher for responses to desktop clients, which can be attributed to the typically more abundant bandwidth (and less optimization requirements) in contrast to a mobile setting (where web content developers might be more considerate of limitations).
In addition, we perform matching of request to mirror the individual example with a direction from desktop to mobile client. 

\subsection{Simulation Model Description}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simulation Model Description}
We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation, which we perform as follows.
For the time period of one week, we randomly select a web page from the mobile dataset and separate the data that is required to be downloaded and the data that is still available in cache due to the maximum expiration age of the individual objects. 
We subsequently wait for a random amount of time before repeating the procedure.

Initially, we sort all landing web pages $l, l=0,\ldots,L$ from the 
dataset based on their popularity ranking.
To simulate the popularity of web pages, it was found that the Zipf distribution effectively describes the popularity of individual requests.
We chose to utilize the non-modified Zipf distribution for our simulation purposes, noting that additional modifications to the distribution exist that can further enhance it, see, e.g., \cite{KrTeSh06}.
For the total number of web pages $L$, we derive the probability of page $l$ being selected in turn as
\begin{equation}
p(l)=\frac{l^{-\alpha}}{\zeta(l)},
\end{equation}
where $\zeta(\cdot)$ denotes the Zeta function. 
We furthermore set $\alpha=0.85$ as an average choice in common ranges utilized for this parameter.

Once the individual mobile web page $l$ was randomly chosen, we compare it to its desktop counterpart, with $\left\{ d,m \right\}$ denoting the request modality.
As each page $l$ exhibits a time-sensitive number of responses, we denote them as $r^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,t)$ and each page exhibits $R^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,t=0)$ in total.
Let $t_c(r^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l))$ denote the expiration or max-age directive received with the response at $r^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,t=0)$.
The number of objects or responses to be retrieved at time $t$ in turn are given as 
\begin{equation}
R^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,t) = \sum_{r^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,0)} \left[ t_c(r^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l)) \ge t \right]
\end{equation}
where $\left[ \cdot \right] $ denotes the Iverson Bracket.
In the following, we abbreviate to $t_c$ for readability when in direct context.

We furthermore denote the size of the individual response retrieved at time $t$ as 
\begin{equation}
x_{r}^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,t) = x_{r}^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,0) \cdot \left[ t_c \ge t \right].
\end{equation}
The total size of objects or responses retrieved at simulation time $t$ thus is given as 
\begin{equation}
X^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,t) =\sum_{r^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,0)} x_{r}^{\left\{ d,m \right\}}(l,t).
\end{equation}


For performance evaluation purposes, we simulate the user behavior similar to the process outlined in~\cite{AnCoGrPa03}, whereby we randomly draw the time between requests $t_u$ as Pareto distributed using
\begin{equation}
p(t_u)=\beta k^\beta t_u^{-(\beta+1)},
\end{equation}
 with $\beta=1.5$, $k=30$.
We assume that no delays are accrued due to instantaneous cache retrievals or downloads. 
Using time index $i$, we thus derive $t_{i+1}=t_i + t_u$.
We continue the simulation until $t_{i+1} = t \ge T =  640800$ [s], i.e., one week.
To maintain tractability, we bundle the presented results into bins of 3600 seconds, i.e., one hour, through averaging.

\section*{Performance Evaluation Results}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Performance Evaluation Results}
\label{s:results}

We present our results for the individual responses or web objects and the total number of bytes.
We note that through approximations, such as the ones described in Section~\ref{s:example}, an inference of energy consumption would be possible as well.
We perform the simulations with an average $\alpha=0.85$ for the utilized Zipf distribution and repeat each week-long evaluation 2000 times.
Initially, we present the total number of responses and bytes that would not require a download (i.e., would reside in the mobile cache) as a function of time in figures \ref{fig:simr_abs_reqs} and \ref{fig:simr_abs_byte}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig6-a}
	\caption{Simulation results for the number of responses that are in the transfered mobile device cache as averages in 1-hour bins..}
	 \label{fig:simr_abs_reqs}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig6-b}
	\caption{Simulation results for the attained savings for the number of bytes by transferring to the mobile device cache in 1-hour bins.}
	 \label{fig:simr_abs_byte}
\end{figure}

We note an immediate decrease in the number of requests, which is mirrored by the number of bytes as well (indicating a linear relationship as observed in, e.g., \cite{JoSe14Commag}).
We furthermore observe that the initial decline levels out at the simulation time of around one day, and  remains steady afterwards.
This indicates that within the simulation period of one week, initially a large number of items is non--shared between devices or exhibits no significant cache lifetime. 
In a following group of objects, cache lifetimes increase logarithmically, which leads to the exponential decline we observe here.
The narrow confidence intervals and low level of standard deviation indicate that the presented results are stable within simulation confines.

Next, we present how these findings translate into attainable savings with respect to requests for objects and bytes in figures \ref{fig:simr_sav_reqs} and \ref{fig:simr_sav_byte} in relationship to the total web page data without caching.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig7-a}
	\caption{Simulation results for the attained savings for the number of requests by transferring to the mobile device cache in 1-hour bins.}
	 \label{fig:simr_sav_reqs}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig7-b}
	\caption{Simulation results for the attained savings for the number of bytes by transferring to the mobile device cache in 1-hour bins.}
	 \label{fig:simr_sav_byte}
\end{figure}

We initially note a declining trend similar to the one observed for the cached items in figures \ref{fig:simr_abs_byte} and \ref{fig:simr_abs_reqs}, but with more distinct ``jumps'' observable at half-day and day times of the simulation.
Overall, we note that almost 15 \% savings for objects and bytes decline to around 10 \% after the boundaries of a day (whereby objects exhibit lower levels and bytes exhibit higher levels).

To evaluate the impact of different web page popularity distributions, we present an evaluation of different $\alpha$ for the Zipf distribution in Figure~\ref{fig:sim3}, each with 500 simulation repetitions for $0.65 \le \alpha \le 1.05$.

We limit our comparison to bytes due to space constraints, noting that results obtained for objects are similar.
\begin{figure}[]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig8}
	\caption{Average proportions of data in mobile cache for different Zipf distribution parameters $\alpha$.}
	\label{fig:sim3}
\end{figure}
We observe that all levels of $\alpha$ exhibit the same underlying trends, with slight and non-linear differences between levels.
We conclude that the distribution of web page popularity and the composition thereof has an overall impact on the long-term level of savings that can be attained.

Overall, we find a significant reduction in the required downloads for mobile clients that can be directly attributed to lower energy consumption levels and potential download latencies (and even costs for the mobile user through saved data transmissions).
Furthermore, this approach does not require sophisticated live evaluations, but only relies on cache forwarding to the mobile device.

\section*{Overnight Caching}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Overnight Caching}

As an additional project, the possible power savings achievable through pre-caching contents of websites. Typically, most people tend to plug their mobile devices into a power source over night while they are sleeping. Also, many people tend to have Wi-Fi access in their homes, which can be accessible by the phone while the user is sleeping. Due to this, during the night or early morning, when a user is usually still sleeping, would be a great time for a mobile phone to go out and pre-cache the webpages a user visited the previous day since users are more likely to visit these same sites again the next day. By performing the pre-caching at night, the user would have the advantage of a power source and a Wi-Fi connection so they don’t drain their battery or data plan. As a result, they may also have faster load times throughout the day when they try to access the webpages since the webpages will already be cached locally on their mobile devices. This can also result in power savings since many of the items on the webpages may already be cached, so the mobile devices won’t have to make as many requests to go out and fetch as many of the required objects for a web page.

\subsection*{Simulation Set Up}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simulation Set Up}
To determine the overall potential savings we will simulate a 24 hour browsing session for a user. The two behavioral attributes of the user that we incorporate into the simulation model are the user think time and the webpage visited. User think time is the time in between page requests that a user spends viewing a web page before navigating to another webpage. The user think time is determined similarly to the process outlined in [4]. The user think time follows a Pareto distribution with $\beta$ = 1.5 and k = 30. Website popularity was shown in [5] to follow a zipf distribution with $\alpha$ = 0.85. So, to determine what webpage the user visits, an integer will be drawn from a zipf distribution with $\alpha$ = 0.85 and the webpage with the corresponding page rank will be the webpage that we simulate the user navigating to. The overall algorithm for simulating a 24 hour user browsing session can be seen below in algorithm \ref{alg:overnight_caching}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\label{alg:overnight_caching}
 \While{time < 86400 (1 day)}{
  Select webpage based on zipf distribution\;
  \If{expAge > time //Item hasn't expired}{
   AccumulateSavings()\;
   }
   time += Pareto($\beta$ = 1.5,k=30)\;
 }

\end{algorithm}

\subsection*{Overall Cache Lifetime Behavior}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Overall Cache Lifetime Behavior}

The overall lifetime of cache objects from mobile sites is shown in Figure \ref{fig:overall_responses_over_24_hours}. Figure \ref{fig:overall_bytes_over_24_hours} depicts the total bytes remaining in cache over a 24 hour period. Roughly 35\% of bytes expire in cache almost immediately. Subsequently, there are also noticeable drops at periods of one hour, four hours, and twelve hours before slowly starting to level off to about 52\% of bytes remaining in cache after 24 hours. Figure \ref{fig:overall_responses_over_24_hours} depicts the total responses remaining in the mobile device’s cache over a 24 hour period. There is also a steep initial drop to about 55\% after the responses with an expiration age of zero expire. There are subsequent noticeable drops at periods of one hour, four hours, six hours, and twelve hours, before starting a steady decline to about 45\% of responses remaining in cache at the end of the 24 hour period.

We ran the simulation for two-thousand rounds to determine the possible savings along with their confidence intervals. The overall savings for a 24 hour period determined from our simulations seen be seen in Figure \ref{fig:simulated_bytes_remaining_in_cache_24_hours} and Figure \ref{fig:simulated_responses_remaining_in_cache_24_hours} along with their confidence intervals. In Figure \ref{fig:simulated_bytes_remaining_in_cache_24_hours}, after the initial drop from cache items with expiration ages of zero, the amount of bytes remaining in cache starts out at 43\% and starts to level off at about 35\% by the end of the day. The most significant visible drops occur at the two hour and twelve hour periods with other smaller noticeable drops throughout the day. Figure \ref{fig:simulated_responses_remaining_in_cache_24_hours} depicts the total proportion of responses remaining in cache over a 24 hour period along with the 95\% confidence intervals. After the initial drop from cache items with expiration ages of zero, the proportion of responses remaining in cache starts out at about 37\% and levels off to about 30\% by the end of the day. As expected, the most visible drops are in similar locations as Figure \ref{fig:simulated_bytes_remaining_in_cache_24_hours}, at the two hour and twelve hour periods with other smaller noticeable drops throughout the day.

\section*{Conclusion}
Performance Evaluation Results
\label{s:conc}
We exemplarily evaluated the content of modern web pages and the identical objects that can be found when requesting the same web page from different devices with different display modalities, such as desktop and smartphone.
Assuming mobile users visit the same pages on their mobile device that they visit on their desktop computer as well, we simulated the access of landing web pages and evaluated the potential for cache forwarding.
Our basic approach is able to save upward of 7.5 \% of mobile request or bytes even for very distant time horizons.
In the more typical daily time range, our approach can yield almost linearly decreasing savings stating at about 14 \%, without requiring any sophisticated prediction mechanisms, but only a direct cache transfer.
We note that similarly, exchanges between mobile and fixed devices belonging to a user are possible, including keeping a cloud-based reference of pages that a user visits (similar to Google Chrome's synchronization features).
