\chapter{Power Consumption Overhead for Proxy Services on Mobile Device Platforms}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
\section*{Introduction}
Current predictions by Cisco show that the amount of data that users consume has increased significantly and will continue to increase into the foreseeable future \cite{VNI14}. Previous studies show that the network interfaces of mobile devices consume much of the limited battery life \cite{Carroll:2010:APC:1855840.1855861}. Thus, heavy research efforts have been poured into studying the possibilities of energy efficient mobile data delivery. Some research avenues have middleware that acts as an on-device proxy service to realize benefits or enable new interaction paradigms, such as display networks \cite{6174992} or mobile content sharing \cite{Seeling:2014:OES:2671189.2671194},\cite{6692468}. To determine whether or not local proxy servers result in a large overhead in terms of power consumption and time delays, the measurement framework testbed described in Chapter \ref{ch:testbed} can be implemented to determine what kind of overheads can be expected from local proxy servers.
