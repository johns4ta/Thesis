	Abstract = {Mobile network providers face an ever-increasing number of mobile devices requesting similarly increasing amounts of data. In this article, we present a two-step approach to modeling and simulating the amounts of data produced by mobile devices based on applications that are highly utilized on the network. In the first step, we separate the applications on a mobile device into highly utilized and background ones for the overall population to be modeled. With the identified overall application groups, we employ a four-state Hidden Markov Model to capture the characteristics of the high utilization applications as aggregates per device; the characteristics of the background applications are matched to four states, dependent on the high utilization aggregates' states. Utilizing the Exponential distribution for both, we closely match their original user-based characteristics. The suitability of our model is lastly corroborated through simulation-based comparisons of estimations for the bandwidth requirements of the individual users; or model's estimates are typically within ten percent of the original values.},

	Abstract = {Hotspot traffic is common in metro ring networks connecting access
	networks with backbone networks, and these metro rings are also expected
	to support a mix of unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic. Shortest
	path (SP) routing, as employed in the IEEE 802.17 Resilient Packet
	Ring (RPR), is widely considered for metro rings as it maximizes
	spatial reuse and, thus, the achievable packet throughput (capacity)
	for uniform traffic. In this paper, we analyze the capacity of bidirectional
	optical ring networks, such as RPR, employing SP routing for multicast
	(nonuniform) hotspot traffic (whereby unicast and broadcast are considered
	as special cases of multicast). We find that, when the traffic originating
	at the hotspot exceeds a critical threshold, then SP routing leads
	to substantial reductions in capacity to a value close to one simultaneous
	packet transmission. To overcome this limitation of SP routing, we
	propose a simple combined SP/one-copy routing strategy that provides
	a capacity of at least two simultaneous packet transmissions.},

	Abstract = {Multi-hop networks have gained a lot of interest in recent years.
	A lot of work was contributed in the field of protocol design and
	performance of multi-hop networks. It is generally accepted that
	mobility has a huge impact on the protocol performance; even more
	for multi-hop networks. Obtaining realistic measurements of mobility,
	however, is complex and expensive. Thus, we adopt virtual world scenarios
	to explore the mobility issue, by using the well-known multi-player
	game, Quake II. The advantage of the Quake II engine is that users
	move within virtual worlds under realistic constraints, whereas other
	mobility models may offer insufficient accuracy or operate under
	unrealistic assumptions. Moreover, it is very easy to create new
	virtual worlds and to adapt them to specialized needs. In this paper,
	we propose an analytical framework for mobility measurements in virtual
	worlds that could be adopted for the design of communication protocols.
	Our framework enables the study of the impact of mobility on connectivity
	and stability of the network, giving useful insights for improving
	communication performance. An interesting application of our approach
	is the analysis of coverage extension of so called hotspots or emergency
	situations, where the fixed network infrastructure is insufficient
	or non-existent. In these extreme cases, multi-hop networks can be
	used to setup communication quickly. As these situations comprise
	a plethora of different cases and scenarios, our model is appropriate
	for their analysis, due to its generality. We use our framework to
	investigate the performance of multi-hop networks based on IEEE 802.11a
	technology. In contrast to other contributions focusing only on connectivity,
	the IEEE 802.11a technology also considers multi-rate connections.
	Our framework covers the evaluation of simple connectivity as well
	as link quality stability in the presence of mobility, a combination
	that has not been considered thus far. Therefore we introduce two
	simple routing schemes and highlight the performance of these protocols
	in presence of mobility. Furthermore we come up with four definitions
	of stability and investigate protocols for multi-hop networks in
	terms of this parameter. Our other contributions are the changes
	to the Quake II engine and the availability of mobility trace files.},

	Abstract = {RObust Header Compression (ROHC) has recently been proposed to reduce
	the large protocol header overhead when transmitting voice and other
	continuous media over IP based protocol stacks in wireless networks.
	In this paper we evaluate the real-time transmission of GSM encoded
	voice and H.26L encoded video with ROHC over a wireless link. For
	the voice transmission we examine the impact of ROHC on the consumed
	bandwidth, the voice quality, and the delay jitter in the voice signal.
	We find that for a wide range of error probabilities on the wireless
	link, ROHC roughly cuts the bandwidth required for the transmission
	of GSM encoded voice in half. In addition, ROHC improves the voice
	quality compared to transmissions without ROHC, especially for large
	bit error probabilities on the wireless link. The improvement reaches
	0.26 on the 5-point Mean Opinion Score for a bit error probability
	of 10-3. For the video transmission we examine the impact of ROHC

	Abstract = {Video services are expected to account for a large portion of the
	traffic in future wireless networks. Therefore, realistic traffic
	sources are needed to investigate the network performance of future
	communication protocols. Previously, we provided a publicly available
	library of frame size traces of long MPEG-4 and H.263 encoded videos
	in the QCIF format resulting in low bandwidth video streams. These
	traces can be used in 3G network simulations. Some future communication
	systems, such as WLAN systems, offer high data rates and therefore
	high quality video can be transmitted over such higher speed networks.
	We now present an addition to our existing trace library. For this
	addition we collected over 100 pre-encoded video sequences from the
	Web, generated the trace files, and conducted a thorough statistical
	evaluation. Because the pre-encoded video sequences are encoded by
	different users, their video settings differ in terms of codec, quality,
	format, and length. The advantage of user diversity for encoding
	is that it reflects very well the traffic situation in upcoming WLANs.
	Thus, the new traces are very suitable for the network performance

	video for streaming over the Internet and for wireless applications.
	``Wavelet-based video coding has been recently added to the JPEG-2000
	video standards. As wavelet encoded video emerges as the next generation
	video encoding method, it is vital to compare the efficiency of wavelet
	encoded video against the widely used DCT-based MPEG encoded video.
	However, due to the lack of long wavelet encoded video streams, most
	research has so far been based on short video traces. This paper
	presents a comparison study on MPEG vs wavelet encoded video traces
	for one hour movie excerpts with rate control. These long video sequences
	allow for the evaluation of long range dependency and self similarity
	of the generated video traffic, which has not been studied before
	in the context of comparing DCT and wavelet-based encoding. We focus
	on the elementary as well as self-similar traffic characteristics
	of the encoded video. A hump behavior for the variability of frame
	sizes is observed for increasing video bit rates for both wavelet
	and MPEG encoded video. In addition, the quality characteristics
	of the encoded video is examined and related to the traffic. Our
	results indicate that the wavelet encoded video results in higher
	video quality than MPEG encoded video. For the frame size variability
	we find different characteristics depending on the aggregation level

	consequences, especially considering special groups, such as the

	early detection of the falling event. Towards reaching the goal of
	early fall detection, we have worked on distinguishing and monitoring
	some basic human activities such as walking and running. Since we
	plan to implement the system mostly for seniors and the disabled,
	simplicity of the usage becomes very important.
	
	We have successfully implemented an algorithm that would not require
	the acceleration sensor to be fixed in a specific position (the smart
	phone itself in our application), whereas most of the previous research
	dictates the sensor to be fixed in a certain direction. This algorithm
	reviews data from the accelerometer to determine if a user has taken
	a step or not and keeps track of the total amount of steps. After
	testing, the algorithm was more accurate than a commercial pedometer
	in terms of comparing outputs to the actual number of steps taken
	by the user.},

	Abstract = {With the increasing popularity of networked multimedia applications,
	video data is expected to account for a large portion of the traffic
	in the Internet of the future and in next-generation wireless systems.
	For transport over networks, video is typically encoded (i.e., compressed)
	to reduce bandwidth requirements. Even compressed video, however,
	requires large bandwidths on the order of 100 kb/s or Mb/s. In addition,
	compressed video streams typically exhibit highly variable bit rates
	(VBRs). This, in conjunction with the stringent quality of service
	(QoS) requirements (loss and delay) of video traffic, makes the transport
	of video traffic over communication networks a challenging problem.
	As a consequence, in the last decade, networking research on all
	aspects of video transport has exploded. The characteristics of video
	traffic, video traffic modeling, as well as protocols and mechanisms
	for the efficient transport of video streams have received a great
	deal of interest among networking researchers and network operators.
	Video traces, which give the sizes of the individual video frames
	in a video sequence, have been emerging as convenient video characterizations
	for networking studies. This article introduces video traces and
